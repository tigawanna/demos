## Roadmap

This project is a work in progress (almost by definition). Here are the current priorities:

- [x] Remove deprecated APIs: runOnJS and runOnUI should now be imported from react-native-worklets
- [x] Drawer Navigation: currently the navigation is quite unintuitive and needs to be improved.
- [x] Ensure consistent haptics support (use [pressto](https://github.com/enzomanuelmangano/pressto) whenever possible)
- [ ] Optimize performance in Shaders demos
- [x] Feedback screen on Shake Detection
- [x] [TestFlight Release](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uB9PQHuT)
- [ ] Android Release (starting with App Tester / Firebase Distribution)
